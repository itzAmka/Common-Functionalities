# Common Functionalities

Here are some common functionalities that you can use to filter, search, and sort your data.

## Filter

For filtering data, I have used the products data from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/). The functionality I implemented is to filter the data based on the category, price range, and rating range of the products.

## Sorting

In sorting, the posts data comes from the [Dummy.io API](https://dummyapi.io/). I have implemented sorting based on the date the post was published.

## Search

For searching, I have used the users data from the [Dummy JSON API](https://dummyjson.com/). The search functionality is implemented based on all the fields of the user data displayed in the table. A bonus feature I implemented is to include pagination for the table data.

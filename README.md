# Filtering Project - Pure Filter Functionality no other functionalities involved in

In this project I'm going to implement a simple filter functionality using Svelte and SvelteKit. The data will be fetched from a [Fake Sstore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/).

## How does it work?

The end user will have a select dropdown to choose the filtering criteria.

options are:

- All
- Category (e.g. Electronics, or Jewelery)
- Price Range (e.g. $0 - $50, or $50 - $100)
- Rating (e.g. 1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars, 4 stars, 5 stars)

## Bonus Features

The user can select one or more options from the dropdown. The products will be filtered based on the selected options.
